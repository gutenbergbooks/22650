<div class="cpoem27"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="id0"><span class="dcap">B</span>UT, knowing now that they would have her speak,<br /></span>
<span class="id0">She threw her wet hair backward from her brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As though she had had there a shameful blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feeling it shameful to feel ought but shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She must a little touch it; like one lame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She walked away from Gauwaine, with her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still lifted up; and on her cheek of flame<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O knights and lords, it seems but little skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk of well-known things past now and dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pray you all forgiveness heartily!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because you must be right, such great lords; still<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Listen, suppose your time were come to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you were quite alone and very weak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, laid a dying while very mightily<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of river through your broad lands running well:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now choose one cloth for ever; which they be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not tell you, you must somehow tell<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At foot of your familiar bed to see<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A great God's angel standing, with such dyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held out two ways, light from the inner skies<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Showing him well, and making his commands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem to be God's commands, moreover, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wavy and long, and one cut short and red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man could tell the better of the two.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">After a shivering half-hour you said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'God help! heaven's colour, the blue;' and he said, 'hell.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps you then would roll upon your bed,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And cry to all good men that loved you well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Launcelot went away, then I could tell,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like wisest man how all things would be, moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roll and hurt myself, and long to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet fear much to die for what was sown.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever may have happened through these years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her voice was low at first, being full of tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Growing a windy shriek in all men's ears,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A ringing in their startled brains, until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her great eyes began again to fill,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though still she stood right up, and never shrunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With passionate twisting of her body there:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell at Arthur's court: at Christmas-time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This happened; when the heralds sung his name,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Son of King Ban of Benwick, seemed to chime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along with all the bells that rang that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Christmas and whitened winter passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over me the April sunshine came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in the Summer I grew white with flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed my head down: Autumn, and the sick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure knowledge things would never be the same,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">However often Spring might be most thick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My eager body; while I laughed out loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let my lips curl up at false or true,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold my judges, then the cloths were brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Belonging to the time ere I was bought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Arthur's great name and his little love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must I give up for ever then, I thought,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That which I deemed would ever round me move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorifying all things; for a little word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will that all folks should be quite happy and good?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love God now a little, if this cord<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Were broken, once for all what striving could<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make me love anything in earth or heaven?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So day by day it grew, as if one should<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to a cool sea on a summer day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until one surely reached the sea at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the lone sea, far off from any ships!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do I not know now of a day in Spring?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No minute of that wild day ever slips<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wheresoever I may be, straightway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was half mad with beauty on that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went without my ladies all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a quiet garden walled round every way;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was right joyful of that wall of stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little thing just then had made me mad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dared not think, as I was wont to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes, upon my beauty; If I had<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Held out my long hand up against the blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round by the edges; what should I have done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And startling green drawn upward by the sun?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trancedly stood watching the west wind run<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With faintest half-heard breathing sound; why there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lose my head e'en now in doing this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shortly listen: In that garden fair<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scarce dare talk of the remember'd bliss,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When both our mouths went wandering in one way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aching sorely, met among the leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hands being left behind strained far away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never within a yard of my bright sleeves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Launcelot come before: and now, so nigh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After that day why is it Guenevere grieves?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever happened on through all those years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Being such a lady could I weep these tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this were true? A great queen such as I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having sinn'd this way, straight her conscience sears;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">My cold stiff palm; there were no colours then<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Through the fresh wet woods, and the wheat that morn,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of love we held, nigh hid among the corn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back to the palace, ere the sun grew high,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We went, and in a cool green room all day<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

<span class="i2">So soon, but vaguely wrenched his strained heart sore<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In shadowy slipping from his grasp: these gone,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Grey horse's head before him vex'd him much,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In steady nodding over the grey road:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still night, and night, and night, and emptied heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of any stories; what a dismal load<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Time grew at last, yea, when the night did part,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And let the sun flame over all, still there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The horse's grey ears turn'd this way and that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he watch'd them twitching in the glare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the morning sun, behind them still he sat,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quite wearied out with all the wretched night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until about the dustiest of the day,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of the Glastonbury roofs that choke the way.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of her presence; yet as he sat and gazed,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As though he had not heard of Arthur's death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This for a moment only, presently<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He rode on giddy still, until he reach'd<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Wherefrom St. Joseph in the days past preached.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">A wicked smile<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You know that I should strangle you<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nay, if you do not my behest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Jehane! though I love you well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Godmar, would I fail to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that I know? Foul lies, she said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eh? lies, my Jehane? by God's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Paris folks would deem them true!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you know, Jehane, they cry for you:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Give us Jehane to burn or drown!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eh! gag me Robert! Sweet my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This were indeed a piteous end<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Her head on a wet heap of hay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And did not dream, the minutes crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round to the twelve again; but she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being waked at last, sigh'd quietly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strangely childlike came, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not. Straightway Godmar's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though it hung on strong wires, turn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most sharply round, and his face burn'd.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For Robert, both his eyes were dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not weep, but gloomily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seem'd to watch the rain; yea, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lips were firm; he tried once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To touch her lips; she reached out, sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vain desire so tortured them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor grey lips, and now the hem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his sleeve brush'd them.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">With a start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up Godmar rose, thrust them apart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Robert's throat he loosed the bands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silk and mail; with empty hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held out, she stood and gazed, and saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long bright blade without a flaw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glide out from Godmar's sheath, his hand<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In Robert's hair; she saw him bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back Robert's head; she saw him send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thin steel down; the blow told well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right backward the knight Robert fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moaned as dogs do, being half dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwitting, as I deem: so then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Godmar turn'd grinning to his men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ran, some five or six, and beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head to pieces at their feet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Godmar turn'd again and said:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Take note, my lady, that your way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies backward to the Chatelet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shook her head and gazed awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At her cold hands with a rueful smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though this thing had made her mad.<br /></span>
